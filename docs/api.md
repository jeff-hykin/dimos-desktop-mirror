# Desktop HTTP API

How do I ...? (notify, open an app, run a sudo command, events): [how-to.md](how-to.md).

One Rust process (`dimos-desktop serve`) on `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` (port from `~/.dimos/config.yaml`, default 5555).
JSON everywhere unless noted. Errors: non-2xx with `{ "error": "<message>" }`.

## `/dimos/` — the dimos tooling API

The only part of Desktop that depends on the dimos version. Apps (the Launcher included) use it instead of shelling out
to dimos. It is served by **the dimos gateway**, its own process on a unix socket, which Desktop proxies `/dimos/` to
and starts on demand with the `start:` command of the `dimos.yaml` in the checkout at `dimos.dir`: dimos's own gateway
(dimos/gateway/), else Desktop's built-in fallback (`dimos-desktop dimos-server`, src/dimos/server.rs) for a checkout
with no `start:` (docs/install.md).

| `PUT /dimos/global-config`    | `{ overrides: { key: value } }`                | same as GET. Overrides are saved in config.yaml and passed as `--key value` on every launch        |

| `POST /dimos/runs`            | `{ blueprint, replay?: bool, overrides?: {} }` | `Launch`. `overrides`: `{ global?, modules? }` for this launch only (launcher.md#config)           |

When the dimos gateway can't be started, `/dimos/*` answers 503 `{ error }` saying why (and where its log is).

### The blueprint view

`GET /dimos/blueprint_view?name=<blueprint>` (dimos API 1.11+, dimos/gateway/blueprint_view/) is a page of the dimos
server's: a blueprint's modules (rarest first) beside its module graph (drawn from the wiring, with Desktop's
`GET /api/topics/rates` on its topics while it runs), each module's streams, skills, RPC methods and code. Its files are
`/dimos/blueprint_view/<file>`; it links Desktop's `/theme.css` and follows the skin in localStorage `portal.theme`. The
bottom bar's Details frames it (ui/src/shell/BlueprintDetails.tsx) with Desktop's own Relaunch, Configure and Logs; a
dimos gateway without it (older, or the built-in one) gets "Update dimos to see the blueprint view". The page and its
parent talk over postMessage on Desktop's origin:

| From → to      | Message                                             | Meaning                                                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| view → Desktop | `{ type: "dimos:open-in-editor", file, line }`      | Open in editor: Desktop runs `POST /api/open-in-editor` for it           |
| Desktop → view | `{ type: "dimos:open-in-editor-result", ok, text }` | what that ran (`opened: <command>`), or why it couldn't                  |
| view → Desktop | `{ type: "dimos:close" }`                           | Escape with nothing left to step back from in the view: the modal closes |

### Dimensional cloud: login and uploads

Uploads go to Dimensional cloud through dimos's own code (`dimos.cloud.data.CloudData().upload`, the same as
`dimos upload`), and the login is `dimos login`'s device flow: the user approves a code in any signed-in browser, and
the key is stored where dimos keeps it (keyring, else a 0600 file; `DIMOS_API_KEY` overrides). The dimos gateway runs
`cloud.py` (src/dimos/, beside introspect.py) with the checkout's python; it reports progress as JSON lines, which the
server turns into a smoothed speed and time left. `DESKTOP_UPLOAD_HELPER=<program>` replaces it (same arguments), for
tests.

| `POST /dimos/cloud/logout`      |                              | the account, logged out                                                                      |
| `GET /dimos/uploads`            |                              | `{ uploads: [Upload], waitingForLogin }`, oldest first                                       |
| `POST /dimos/uploads`           | `{ path, robotId?, kind? }`  | `Upload`. 400 for a path that isn't an existing `.mcap` / `.db`. Same path queued → that one |
| `DELETE /dimos/uploads`         |                              | `{ uploads, waitingForLogin }`: the finished ones (done, failed, cancelled) cleared          |
| `DELETE /dimos/uploads/:id`     |                              | `{ ok: true }`: a queued or running one is cancelled, a finished one removed                 |
| `POST /dimos/uploads/:id/retry` |                              | `Upload`, queued again at the back (409 while it is queued or running)                       |
| `GET /dimos/uploads/uploaded`   | `?path=` for one             | `{ byPath: { [path]: Uploaded } }`, or with `?path=` that `Uploaded` or `null`               |
| `GET /dimos/cloud/login/page`   | `?theme=light\|dark`         | an HTML page for an app's iframe that runs the login (below)                                 |

The queue is first in, first out, one at a time, and kept in `<DIMOS_HOME>/desktop/uploads.json`: one that was uploading
when the server stopped is queued again and dimos resumes it (the cloud keeps the parts it has). When an upload finds no
login it goes back to the front of the queue and `waitingForLogin` turns true; an approved login (or an account check
that finds one) starts the queue again. Errors are one readable sentence plus `errorCode`; the traceback is in `log`
(`<DIMOS_HOME>/desktop/logs/uploads.log`). Failed uploads also go into Desktop's error feed (docs/agent.md). Every done
upload is also remembered by path in `<DIMOS_HOME>/desktop/uploaded.json`, which clearing the list doesn't touch:
`GET /dimos/uploads/uploaded` says which recordings are in the cloud (for a link instead of an upload button), and
`changed` says the file is different now (its size or modification time). An app can run the login itself (`POST`, show
`code`, open `urlComplete` in a new tab, poll `GET`) or put `/dimos/cloud/login/page` in an iframe, which does that and
posts
`{ type: "dimos-cloud-login", state: "loggedIn" | "loggedOut" | "approved" | "denied" | "expired" | "failed" |
"cancelled", email }`
to its parent. The console's own page can't be framed (its sign-in sends `X-Frame-Options: DENY`), so the approval
always happens in a new tab or another device. `<ns>/dimos/events/upload` carries `{ type: "upload", upload }` on every
change (progress a few times a second), `{ type: "uploads", waitingForLogin }`, `{ type: "upload-removed", id }` and
`{ type: "cloud-login", login }`.

```ts
type Login = {

## `/recordings/` — the shared recordings folder

Every recording apps make or open lives in one folder: `recordings.dir` in config.yaml (empty = `~/.dimos/recordings`,
under `DIMOS_HOME` when set), plus optional read-only `recordings.extra_dirs`. `.mcap` and `.db` (dimos memory2 SQLite)
files, up to one sub-folder deep. App servers get the folder as `DIMOS_APP`'s `recordingsDir`. An `id` is the path
relative to its folder (`live-viewer/drive.mcap`); extra folders' ids start `extra<N>/`.

| `POST /recordings/new`        | `{ name, format }` | `{ id, path }` — a free path in the main folder; the app writes the file there |
| `POST /recordings/:id/rename` | `{ name }`         | `Recording`                                                                    |
| `DELETE /recordings/:id`      |                    | `{ ok: true }` (main folder only; extra folders are read-only)                 |

```ts

    start: number | null // seconds since the epoch, over all streams
    end: number | null
    duration: number | null
    // .db: one per memory2 stream (type = dimos type, e.g. "sensor_msgs.PointCloud2"); .mcap: one per channel (type = schema name)
    streams: [{ name: string; type: string; count: number; start: number | null; end: number | null }]
}
```

`<ns>/desktop/events/recordings` (zenoh, [events.md](events.md)) carries `{ type: "recordings" }` after a rename or
delete.

### Notification actions and modals

`actions` are `[label, action]` buttons. An action is one of:

| Action                              | What the button does                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<app>`, `open:<app>[/<path>]`      | opens the app (a built-in's path is its section: `open:settings/settings-updates`)                                                                         |
| `open:appstore/app=<pkg>&log=<job>` | the App Store on that app, with that job's log sheet open (while Desktop keeps the job: 30 minutes)                                                        |
| `open:launcher/?blueprint=<bp>`     | the Launcher with that blueprint selected                                                                                                                  |
| `chat`, `events`                    | the agent's chat; nothing (the panel)                                                                                                                      |
| `toast:<text>`                      | a toast                                                                                                                                                    |
| `run:<blueprint>`, `stop`           | launches a blueprint; stops the running one                                                                                                                |
| `logs:<blueprint>[/<runId>]`        | that run's Details on its Logs                                                                                                                             |
| `post:<path>[ <json>]`              | POSTs to a Desktop or app endpoint; a JSON body may follow one space (`post:/api/apps/x/update {"force":true}`). Its answer's `message`/`error` is toasted |
| `modal:<key>` (or `modal`)          | opens `modals[key]` (`modal`: the first one)                                                                                                               |
| `dismiss`                           | dismisses this notification (a modal's Cancel)                                                                                                             |
| `close`                             | closes the modal (in a modal's buttons)                                                                                                                    |

`modals` is `{ <key>: { title?, body, pre?, copy?, actions? } }`: what a `modal:<key>` button opens, kept with the
notification, so it opens later from the panel too. `title` defaults to the notification's. `body` is markdown
(paragraphs, `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``, fences, `-`/`1.` lists, `#` headings, http(s) links; HTML is
escaped). `pre` is preformatted text under it (a log, a traceback; its last 20000 characters are kept, and it opens
scrolled to its end). `copy: true` adds a Copy button for the body and the pre (a string: copies that). `actions` are
the modal's own buttons, the same kinds; the first is styled as the decision, and any button but `modal:<key>` closes
the modal after it runs (no `actions`: a Close button). A `modal:<key>` that names no modal is a 400, as is a `post:`
body that isn't JSON; at most 8 modals.

```json
{
    "title": "Switching Rerun to v0.1.7 needs your OK",
    "body": "dim-rerun's pages connect outside Desktop.",
    "kind": "warn",
    "actions": [["Review & allow", "modal:review"]],
    "modals": {
        "review": {
            "title": "Let Rerun connect outside Desktop?",
            "body": "**It asks to reach:**\n- http://*:* (any machine, any port)",
            "actions": [
                ["Allow and switch to v0.1.7", "post:/api/apps/dim-rerun/checkout {\"ref\":\"v0.1.7\",\"force\":true}"],
                ["Cancel", "dismiss"]
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Desktop's own notifications use them: an App Store job that needs the user's OK (its pages connect outside Desktop, or
it needs what this Desktop doesn't have) offers **Review & allow** (or **Review**): a modal with exactly what it asks
for and the same decision the App Store's buttons make (the request again with `force`). A failed install, update or
version switch offers **Show details** (the error and the job log's tail, Copy, Retry, Open in App Store) and **Retry**,
and **Open <app>** only while the app is still installed and built; a finished one, **Open <app>**. A blueprint that
failed offers **Show details** (the error, the exception it ended with and its last output, with Open logs, Open in
Launcher, Run again) and **Open in Launcher**; one that stopped, **Run again**. A rolled-back Desktop update posts one
with its reason and the watchdog's lines.

### Desktop events (zenoh `<ns>/desktop/events/<type>`)

Published on zenoh, one JSON object `{type, …}` per sample; pages hear them through zenoh-gateway
([events.md](events.md)). `dimos` events go to `<ns>/dimos/events/<type>` unwrapped. (`GET /api/events`, the old SSE
stream, is deprecated and internal, kept one release.)

## Desktop describing itself: OpenAPI, dimos.yaml, the endpoint registry, call counts

For tools that explore a running system (the Endpoint Explorer app) and for the agent. Same origin, so an app's page
calls them directly (`fetch("/api/endpoints/stats")`). Source: `src/server/openapi.rs`, `src/server/call_stats.rs`.

| Method + path                 | Query   | Response                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/desktop/openapi`    |         | an OpenAPI 3.1 document of every route Desktop serves (its own and the dimos gateway's)         |
| `GET /api/desktop/dimos.yaml` |         | `text/yaml`: Desktop's dimos.yaml plus `title` and `agent: { description, endpoints }`          |
| `GET /api/endpoints`          | `?app=` | `{ apps: [RegistryApp] }`: the registry `search_endpoints` searches                             |
| `GET /api/endpoints/stats`    |         | `EndpointStats`: calls per endpoint, by family                                                  |
| `GET /agent/api/openapi`      |         | the agent gateway's own routes, as OpenAPI 3.1 (served by dimcode, through the `/agent/` proxy) |

**The OpenAPI document** lists every route registered in Desktop's router and the dimos gateway's (a test parses both
routers' source and fails on a route the document lacks). Each operation has `operationId`, `summary`, `description`,
`tags` (one group), `parameters` (path and, for GET/DELETE, query), `requestBody` (POST/PUT JSON fields), `responses`
(the shape, in words) and:

- `x-family`: `"dimos"` for `/dimos/...` (the dimos gateway), else `"desktop"`
- `x-agent: true`: one of `endpoints::builtins()`, which the agent finds through `search_endpoints`
- `x-mcp-tool`: the MCP tool(s) that do the same, e.g. `notify` for `POST /api/notifications`

The group docs are in `tags[].description` (markdown, with `x-family`): how the dimos gateway is started and proxied,
blueprint enumeration and the blueprint file watcher, runs and launch phases, logs, config introspection
(introspect.py), cloud uploads; apps (install, update, serving), notifications, UI settings, the HUD, topics and
zenoh-gateway, search, the event stream, the agent and MCP, auth, recordings, windows, errors, the installer, the
Launcher and these endpoints. Desktop's own websocket (a shell session's terminal) and the deprecated SSE `/api/events`
are internal to its UI and CLI: not in the document, and apps must not rely on them.

```ts
type RegistryApp = {
    app: string // "desktop", "launcher", or an installed app's name
    title: string
    description: string
    // where the endpoints came from: Desktop's built-ins, or the app's dimos.yaml `agent:` merged with the file it
    // serves (the served file wins: "agent.json", else "openapi.json"; just "dimos.yaml" when it serves neither)
    source: "builtin" | "dimos.yaml" | "agent.json" | "openapi.json"
    manifestUrl?: string // "/api/desktop/dimos.yaml" for Desktop, "/apps/<name>/agent.json" for a served one
    endpoints: {
        method: string
        path: string // absolute for Desktop's ("/dimos/runs"), relative for an app's ("api/open")
        description: string
        params: { [name: string]: { type?: string; description?: string; required: boolean } }
        role?: "view" | "context"
    }[]
}
type EndpointStats = {
    since: number // ms since the epoch counting started (Desktop's start)
    now: number
    totals: { calls: number; errors: number; perSec: number }
    families: { [family: string]: EndpointCount[] } // "desktop", "dimos", "agent", "app:<name>"
}
type EndpointCount = {
    method: string
    path: string // the path template ("/dimos/blueprints/{name}", "api/open"), "(frontend)", or the raw path
    calls: number
    errors: number // responses with status >= 400
    lastCall: number | null // ms since the epoch
    meanMs: number // to the response's headers (a stream counts until it starts)
    perSec: number // calls in the last 10 s / 10
    matched: boolean // false: no registry path fits, so `path` is the raw path
}
```

### Call counts

A middleware around the whole router (outside auth, so refused requests count too) counts every request Desktop serves
or proxies, once its response headers are ready:

| Request                                                          | Family       | `path`                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/api/…`, `/mcp`, `/recordings…`, `/healthz`, `/zenoh-gateway/…` | `desktop`    | the OpenAPI path template it fits                                                                                                                                  |
| anything else (the embedded UI's files)                          | `desktop`    | `(frontend)`                                                                                                                                                       |
| `/dimos/…`                                                       | `dimos`      | the dimos gateway route it fits (`/dimos/blueprints/{name}/config`)                                                                                                |
| `/agent/…`                                                       | `agent`      | the gateway route it fits, from its `GET /api/openapi` (`/api/settings`)                                                                                           |
| `/apps/<name>/…`                                                 | `app:<name>` | the app's endpoint it fits (`api/open`); `agent.json` / `openapi.json` (its manifest, which Desktop reads for the registry); another non-`api/` path: `(frontend)` |

- A template's `{param}` takes one path segment; only when nothing fits that way may it take several (a recording id
  like `live/a.mcap`). The template with the most literal segments wins.
- A request no template fits is kept under its raw path with `matched: false`; past 100 such paths in a family the rest
  go under `(other)`. When an app's manifest (or the agent's routes) later gains a fitting endpoint, those counts move
  to it.
- App templates come from the registry, re-read at startup, every 60 s and after an app changes. The agent's are fetched
  from its socket after the first `/agent/` request, then at most once a minute (never starting the agent).
- `GET /api/endpoints/stats` isn't counted (polling the stats would count itself).
- The agent's `call_endpoint` and app servers' calls back into Desktop go through Desktop's HTTP server, so they count
  like a page's.

Live: `<ns>/desktop/events/endpoint-stats` carries
`{ type: "endpoint-stats", at, totals, changed: [{ family, method, path, calls, errors,
perSec, lastCall }] }` at most
once a second, only when something changed: an endpoint was called, or its `perSec` decayed since the last event (so a
quiet endpoint's rate reaches 0). Keep the full table from `GET /api/endpoints/stats` and patch it with `changed`.

## Network access

Desktop listens on `127.0.0.1` unless network access is on (`desktop.host: 0.0.0.0`), which needs a password (setup asks
for one, or generates and prints one when an agent runs it; `dimos-desktop password` or Settings → Network access
changes it). Without a password Desktop refuses to listen beyond localhost: its UI includes a terminal.

- This machine (a loopback peer) never needs the password.
- Any other peer gets 401 for everything but `/healthz`, `/api/auth*` and the shell's own files until it logs in
  (`POST /api/auth/login` → an HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict session cookie, which websockets and app iframes send too). The
  page remembers a typed password in localStorage and logs in with it next time.
- A page this machine opened through one of its own LAN addresses (so it looks remote) asks
  `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/api/auth/local-token` for a token and logs in with it, so the user here never types the
  password. That endpoint answers only loopback callers, and with CORS only for an `Origin` that is this Desktop's port
  on an address this machine owns; elsewhere the request just fails and the login form shows.
- The password is stored salted and stretched (`desktop.password_hash`); the session token derives from it, so changing
  the password signs everyone out.
- Anything that forwards traffic into localhost (an SSH tunnel, a `tailscale serve`, a local proxy) looks local and
  skips the password.

## App plumbing

- `/apps/<name>/…` — a static app's files, or forwarded to its `dimos-app-server` socket with `/apps/<name>` removed
  (websockets too).
- `/zenoh-gateway/…` — the embedded zenoh-gateway; app pages reach it at `../../zenoh-gateway` (relative to
  `/apps/<name>/`). When a compatible zenoh-gateway (`>=0.5 <0.6`) already listens on `zenoh_gateway.external_port`
  (default 7448; 0 = never), Desktop proxies to it instead and starts the embedded one again when it goes away; the URL
  apps use doesn't change. `GET /zenoh-gateway/zenoh-gateway/ice` gets Cloudflare TURN credentials
  (`zenoh_gateway.cloudflare_turn`) and `iceTransportPolicy: "relay"` (`zenoh_gateway.relay_only`) added.
